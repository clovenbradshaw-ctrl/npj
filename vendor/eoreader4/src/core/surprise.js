// THE ONE SURPRISE — the modality-agnostic core (Track A, docs/spec-one-surprise.md).
//
// There is exactly one surprise: D_KL(posterior ‖ prior) over a γ-decayed referent
// profile in a fixed basis. The profile is the BACKWARD object — the γ-decayed summary
// of what has arrived; the posterior is that profile advanced one step (every incumbent
// decays by γ, every atom delivered this step deposits γ⁰ = 1). A fixed NOVELTY reserve
// atom keeps the divergence defined on a newcomer (absolute continuity) and makes an
// opening fall to exactly zero on its own.
//
// This is the form `reading.js` already computed for the text Bayesian-surprise channel,
// lifted out verbatim so it is the ONLY form. The only modality-specific code is the
// FRONT-END map from raw signal into the basis: `prior` and `arrival` are Maps from a
// basis-atom (an arbitrary key — a proposition for text, a tonal move for music, a cell
// for the phasepost path) to a mass, and `axisLabel` renders an atom to a readable strain
// axis. Everything here — the posterior, the divergence, the reserve, the per-dimension
// contribution — is shared.
//
// Operations and their ORDER are preserved exactly from reading.js so the text path stays
// byte-identical: the parity gate is `node --test tests/*.test.js` (docs/spec-one-surprise.md).

export const NOVELTY_RESERVE = 1.0;   // reserved prior mass for an as-yet-unseen atom — the SEED

// noveltyAmplitude — the SIGNAL-DERIVED reserve (the protention learning its own amplitude).
//
// The constant above is a hand-rolled prior: it reserves the SAME mass for an unseen atom
// whether newcomers are pouring in or the cast has long since closed. The reserve SHARE
// `novelty/(ΣmassΒ+novelty)` then moves only as accumulated mass grows — blind to the RATE at
// which genuine newcomers actually arrive. This derives the reserve from the signal instead:
// the γ-decayed count of recent FIRST-appearances. An atom first seen at step `f` contributes
// γ^(at−1−f); a flurry of newcomers lifts the reserve (the unseen is plausible), a long drought
// lets it decay (a newcomer becomes a shock). `firstSeen` is the collection of first-appearance
// steps of the atoms in the prior; only those strictly before `at` count, so the reserve is
// strictly CAUSAL — a reading never reads its own future. Returns 0 at the opening (no prior);
// callers fall back to NOVELTY_RESERVE as the cold-start seed rather than collapsing to zero.
//
// Measured aggregate-flat against its controls (experiments/exp-0002): it helps signals with
// positively-autocorrelated novelty and regresses anti-correlated ones, so it ships OPT-IN and
// is NOT promoted. Kept here, in the genome, as the recorded variant the next cycle improves on.
